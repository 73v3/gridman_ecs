As usual, we require an ECS-first, performant, and elegant solution that perfectly solves our problem while adhering to Bevy's best practices for modularity, efficiency, and maintainability.

We are using Bevy 0.16.1, so avoid all deprecated APIs or fields (e.g., use .delta_secs() instead of .delta_seconds()). Refer to the existing codebase for examples of correct syntax and patterns when in doubt, and ensure compatibility with Bevy's current features.

Before writing any code, think step-by-step through your design strategy out loud: outline the problem requirements, brainstorm multiple architectural options (e.g., different component/system/query designs), evaluate their trade-offs in terms of performance, simplicity, and extensibility, and justify your selection of the optimal approach.

If applicable, use the code_execution tool to prototype or verify non-Bevy-specific logic (e.g., file I/O, string manipulation) during your reasoning phase. Focus on edge cases or complex logic that benefits from isolated testing, but avoid attempting to execute Bevy-specific ECS or rendering functionality.

Professionally comment all new code and retain all existing comments.

Output all changed or new files in full, each in its own dedicated codebox. Do not output unchanged files or partial diffsâ€”provide complete, compilable files.

After outputting all files, provide a concise summary (outside of codeboxes) that recaps the key changes, evaluates their merits (e.g., how they improve performance, readability, or solve edge cases), and suggests any potential future improvements.
